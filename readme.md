Flatmate WFH bill calculator
------------------------------

As a consequence to the work from home vs work from the office situation, flatmates can differ largely in the number of hours they utilize home resources (electricity, rent, water, etc). 

This is a simple calculator that generates flatmates' shares of bills, based on the number of hours they spend at home. It takes flatmate details (name, number of days working at the office, total number of hours spent commuting and working on those days) and a bill details ($ amount), and calculates the approximate number of hours each flatmate is present at home, and their share of the bill based on these hours.

Note: the app assumes you are calculating for the current month, so it uses the total number of days of the current month.

To run the calculator, use the terminal and browse to the root, then run:
python main.py
